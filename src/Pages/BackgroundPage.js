                <h1>A bit more about me</h1>
                <p>I've been programming ever since I was 14 years old, I first discovered it in my first Computer Science class and ever since I've been hooked. I remember
                    initally hating as I had gotten stuck on a problem hours upon ends, but the feeling of relief and acomplishment flooded in after I finally solved the problem.
                    Ever since then I've come to love overcoming difficult problems and challenging myself.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not racking my brain on problems you can find me in the boxing gym or on a run </p>
